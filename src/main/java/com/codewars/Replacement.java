//Introduction
//        Little Petya very much likes sequences. However, recently he received a sequence as a gift from his mother.
//        Petya didn't like it at all! He decided to make a single replacement. After this replacement, Petya would like to the sequence in increasing order.
//        He asks himself: What is the lowest possible value I could have got after making the replacement and sorting the sequence?
//
//        About the replacement
//        Choose exactly one element from the sequence and replace it with another integer > 0. You are not allowed to replace a number with itself, or to change no number at all.
//
//        Task
//        Find the lowest possible sequence after performing a valid replacement, and sorting the sequence.
//
//        Input:
//        Input contains sequence with N integers. All elements of the sequence > 0. The sequence will never be empty.
//
//        Output:
//        Return sequence with N integers â€” which includes the lowest possible values of each sequence element, after the single replacement and sorting has been performed.
//
//        Examples:
//
//        ([1,2,3,4,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]
//        ([4,2,1,3,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]
//        ([2,3,4,5,6])  =>  [1,2,3,4,5]
//        ([2,2,2])      =>  [1,2,2]
//        ([42])         =>  [1]
//        ([1, 1, 1])    =>  [1, 1, 2]
